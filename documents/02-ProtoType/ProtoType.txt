By using the prototype pattern, we no longer need to create multiple objects from the same class. In the prototype class, 
we create several objects of the class and finally use it

for example:

tip(we create just one object then only will clone)

    //------ProtoType--used-----
    ProtoType object1=new ProtoType();
    ProtoType object2=(ProtoType)object1.clone1();
    
    object2.Display();
