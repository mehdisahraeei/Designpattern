factory pattern: This pattern is mostly used when there are more classes and this pattern reduces the complexity


        Media //interface


        //------factory--used-----
        FactoryProducer producer=new FactoryProducer();
        Media media=producer.setMedia("film");
        media.dispMedia("New Film");
